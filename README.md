Activity Heat Map

The Activity Heat Map is a social application that allows one to explore the activities currently engaged in the region,
and enables easy participation in the community. The mechanism is provided by the portable routers implemented using
Raspberry PI. These newly implemented routers will serve as the stationary routers that communicates with all the
surrounding routers and records information such as the location of the router, number of users in the range, and types
of activity being engaged. The map then exhibits the abundance and the types of activity by different hues and shades of
colors. Base on these information, one could explore the social activities in the region, and join them. Furthermore,
this application can be useful for more types of intentions, for instance, researchers who needs to complete a survey
about sports can go to an abundant region where users are doing sports. Similarly, businesses can post advertisements
and flyers in the high abundance regions having activities related to the business.
